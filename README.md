# MapEditor

This is a project from Code for All's Full Stack Developer bootcamp.
Our challenge was to design a paint-like, map editor program in which we would be able to paint and unpaint cells and that we would be able to persist drawings.

In this implementation, there are a few extra features:
- We have a command list schema that shows up when you start the program, if you want to hide the picture just press I (and again to show it again)
- Hit Z if you want to change the color you want to paint with.
- C to clear the whole grid.
- P to load a Pikachu painted on the grid.
- S to save you drawing to a file - it then persists if you close and reopen the program, it will still be able to redraw your drawing.
- L to load any existing drawings.
- Q to close the program
- Arrow keeps to move along the grid.
- Press SPACE to paint
- Press SPACE continuously and join in an arrow keep to keep painting
